# Algorithms
Implementation of fundamental algorithms that has three specific criteria: simple, standalone, and short. 

## Why
Every single time I went on to find some algorithm's implementation in a given language it's often full
of pain and misery. StackOverflow is a good resource but often the code found there is somewhat too specific
to a problem. Or someone has some issue with a piece of code and so it is faulty.

Another problem is people get too fancy with their implementation, importing a whole library to do something
simple as string comparison. Sometimes I just want something simple that just works and does not require
too much brain power to understand. This is the motivation behind creating a repository.

## Why Are They So Special
Following are the criteria I used to implement these algroithms.

- Simple
- Short
- Does not require any extra library import (so you can copy-paste away)
- Does not require a specific modern version of compiler support

## Use Cases
Due to their short and self-sustaining nature, these implementations are useful are pretty much everywhere,
especially at an embedded system environment where there is minimal library support and code require
compactness. If you are learning about algorithms for school or work, you will find them useful too. That is
actually one reason I am going to put some time into this: I am getting ready for a job interview circuit so
it works out.

## Repository Structure
At this moment, I will be implementing these algorithms in C and Python. At the top level, you could see the
directory named after the language. Further down, the directory is marked with the name of the algorithm. It
contains the implementation, a short README file, and a testcase file.

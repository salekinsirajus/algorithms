# Data Structures
This directory contains implementation of different standard data structures.
Usually there are better, faster, and optimized versions can be found as part
of the standard library implementation. Regardless, I am reinventing the wheel
for educational purposes.

## Structure
Each subdirectory contains three files: the data structure itself, a test file
to ensure the validitity of the implementation, and a benchmark file comparing
the performance with the standard library implemetation.
